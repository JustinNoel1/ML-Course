# ML-Course
This repository contains material to accompany the course on Machine Learning for Mathematicians that I taught at the University of Regensburg. Under exercise-sessions you will find the very rough results of my quasi-live coding sessions where I would solve various ML programming exercises and implement some of the basic algorithms before my students. 

The other directories just contain code for generating figures for the accompanying [blog](http://nullplug.org/ML-Blog/).
