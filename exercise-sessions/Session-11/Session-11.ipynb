    "First the exercise:\n",
    "* What is the maximum depth of a decision tree trained on $N$ samples?\n",
    "The decision tree must make a proper split at each node, so the size of each node must reduce by at least one as we move down one level. So the maximum depth of a  decision tree is $N-1$.\n",
    "* If we train a decision tree to an arbitrary depth, what will be the training error?\n",
    "Assuming the training data assigns unique labels to samples with identical features, this will be Zero. If we train a decision tree to arbitrary depth we will end up with a tree where each node contains samples with identical features. If each of these samples has the same label than any of the standard rules (voting, averaging) will return the correct response.\n",
    "* How can we alter a loss function to help regularize a decision tree?\n",
    "One of the simplest ways is to add to our loss function an increasing function of the depth of the node. For example, we could just add $\\lambda |D|$ or perhaps $\\lambda 2^|D|$ where $\\lambda$ is an appropriate hyperparameter (probably very small). One should choose so that growth of this regularization term so that it will not dominate the unregularized cost function when obtaining improvements at the desired rate. \n",
